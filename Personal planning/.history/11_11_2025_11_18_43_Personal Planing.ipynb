    "## (1) Data Description \n",
    "The project will use two datasets, **`players.csv`** and **`sessions.csv`**, both describing player demographics, in-game behaviour, and engagement metrics from an online game.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`players.csv`** contains player-level information such as unique IDs, demographics (e.g., age, gender, region), and whether the player has **subscribed to a game-related newsletter**.\n",
    "- **`sessions.csv`** records player activity during gameplay sessions, including metrics such as session duration, number of sessions, total playtime, number of actions, and purchase history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the question is focus on the potential relation of player characteristics and subscribing to a game-related newsletter. We will mainly focus on the **`players.csv`** which contains all the important imformations. It has 7 valid variables and 2 variable without any data, 196 observatioons in total. Here is the detailed descriptiion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **experience**: category variable, describe the player's experience on game. Range is between \"beginner\", \"regular\", \"veteran\", \"amateur\" and \"pro\".\n",
    "- **subscribe**: category variable, describe whether the player subscribe to a game-related newsletter or not.\n",
    "- **hashedEmail**: nominal variable, record player's email\n",
    "- **played_hours**: quantative value, record how many hours the player played.\n",
    "- **name**: nominal variable, record players' name\n",
    "- **gender**: category varibale, record players' gender\n",
    "- **age**: quantative variable. record players' age\n",
    "- **individualId**: No data\n",
    "- **organizationName**: No data\n",

    "**Potential issues and considerations:**\n",
    "- Skewed distributions in engagement variables.\n",
    "- Potential class imbalance in the response variable (`subscribed_newsletter`), as non-subscribers are likely to dominate.\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets may have been collected from in-game logs and user profiles, which could introduce selection bias toward active players.\n",

    "- Engagement metrics (average session duration, total sessions, play frequency)\n",
